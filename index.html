    <h2>
        My name is <span>Kelly P. Canlas</span>, I live in <span>Tondo, Manila</span>.  
        My father's name is Roberto Canlas and my mother's name is Imelda Canlas.  
        I have ten siblings, but two of them have passed away.  

        A short story about myself: I learned early in Tondo, Manila,  
        the importance of perseverance and the strength found in togetherness.  
        I'm studying at the <span>TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES</span>.  
        I am pursuing my studies to prove to my family that I can graduate and to help them,  
        as I am the only one left studying among my siblings.  

        I'm also trying to achieve despite being very shy because of people's judgments.  
        But I don't need to mind them because I know my own capabilities,  
        and I want to learn more and enhance my knowledge of things I have yet to know or try.  
        Even though I'm sometimes afraid, I manage, especially in my course as a teacher.
